Cloud Jump 2
================

Expanding on the original [Cloud Jump][1] created by [BashedCrab][2]. Special thanks to [cclauss][3] and [jsbain][4] for their contributions. 

Additional completed features so far:
------
* Sound Effects (when bouncing on a cloud and when dying)
* Play in Portrait or Landscape Mode
* Player's High Score is saved
	* Player's name is also saved, and only needs to be entered by the player once.

See the [repo's issue page][5] to find out what is being worked on and what will be implemented next.
